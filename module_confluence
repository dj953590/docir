Create a Confluence page for the PromptWizard framework based on the provided Python code. The page should include the following sections:

1. **Overview**:
   - Provide a high-level description of the PromptWizard framework.
   - Explain its purpose and how it automates prompt optimization for large language models (LLMs).

2. **Key Features**:
   - List the key features of PromptWizard, such as feedback-driven critique & synthesis, chain-of-thought reasoning, and synthetic data generation.
   - Highlight its ability to work in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

3. **Code Walkthrough**:
   - Break down the Python code into logical sections (e.g., initialization, prompt mutation, scoring, critique, synthesis, synthetic data generation).
   - Explain the purpose of each method and how it contributes to the overall framework.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - Provide an example of how to use the PromptWizard framework.
   - Include the task description, initial prompt, training data, and thinking styles.
   - Show the output of the optimized prompt and synthetic examples.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Suggest potential improvements or extensions to the framework.
   - Include ideas for integrating with other tools, handling more complex tasks, or optimizing performance.

Use clear and concise language, and include code snippets where appropriate. Ensure the content is well-organized and easy to follow for developers and technical users.

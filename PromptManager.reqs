Based on the PromptWizard framework detailed in the paper "PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework" , we can define a set of high-level JIRA epics and user stories to guide the development of a Prompt Manager. This Prompt Manager will enable a Transaction Manager to manage and optimize prompts effectively.([GitHub][1])

**User Story 1.2**: *As a Transaction Manager, I want to tag prompts with specific tasks or categories to organize them efficiently.*

* **Tasks**:

  * Implement tagging functionality.
  * Allow filtering and searching based on tags.

### **Epic 2: Integration with PromptWizard Optimization**

**User Story 3.2**: *As a Transaction Manager, I want to compare different prompt versions to select the best one.*

* **Tasks**:

  * Implement side-by-side comparison of prompt outputs.
  * Allow rating and selection of preferred versions.

### **Epic 4: User Access and Permissions**

**User Story 4.1**: *As an Admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions to control access to prompt management features.*

* **Tasks**:

  * Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
  * Define roles such as Admin, Editor, and Viewer with appropriate permissions.

**User Story 4.2**: *As a Transaction Manager, I want to share prompts with team members for collaboration.*

* **Tasks**:

  * Implement sharing functionality.
